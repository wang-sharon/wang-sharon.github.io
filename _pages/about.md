I am a researcher with a passion for exploring the complex dynamics of
gender-based violence. Drawing concepts from intersectional feminism
and social justice, my work centers around examining the interplay of
individual and contextual factors that contribute to the experience
and outcomes of sexual violence and intimate partner violence,
particularly in underrepresented populations. I employ a diverse range
of research methods, including data science, quantitative and
qualitative psychology, and statistics. Through my work, I hope to
contribute to a greater understanding of the nuanced and multifaceted
factors that perpetuate gender-based violence and its associated
sequelae. Ultimately, my goal is to create personalized, innovative
solutions for victim-survivors so that suffering is no longer the
default outcome.

Currently, I am a clinical psychology PhD student at the University of
Washington, advised by [Dr. William
H. George](https://psych.uw.edu/directory/2743) and [Dr. Mary
Larimer](https://psych.uw.edu/directory/2697). I am also mentored by
[Dr. Jessica Blayney](https://jessicablayney.com/) and [Dr. Anna
Jaffe](https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/anna-jaffe/). In my spare
time, I like to travel, hike, ice skate, knit, and annoy my
[cat](https://www.instagram.com/juno_thefloof/).
